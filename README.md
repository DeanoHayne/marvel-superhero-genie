### An app by GROUP D: Jess, Andrew, Helen and Deano

## Purpose
The Marvel Superhero Genie app was created collaboratively by the GROUP D team. The real-world problem the app solves is how to access top quality Marvel Superhero information with one click in one place. Without the Marvel Superhero Genie you need to search for info about your favourite superhero on Google and then find a quality video starring that superhero in YouTube. The Marvel Superhero app gets all its superhero information from the source of truth, Marvel, **TODO link to marvel website** so the best information is made available to you with one click. Even better, the search minimises typing because you only need to enter the first few letters of your superhero name to get your superhero's info and video.

## Project Requirements

The requirements guiding the initial build of the Marvel Superhero Genie app were:

* As a Marvel fan, I can enter one or more letters in a superhero name search so that I can see the first superhero name that matches the entered letters.
* As a Marvel fan, I can read more about the superhero returned by my search, such as their bio, so that I can learn more about that superhero.
* As a Marvel fan, I can see an image of the superhero returned by my search, so that I can learn more abut about my superhero.
* As a Marvel fan, I can watch the Youtube video of my superhero in the app, so that I don’t need to spend effort opening up Google or YouTube and entering another search.
* As a Marvel fan, I can choose to open the YouTube video starring the superhero on the YouTube site so that I can continue searching for and watching the superhero’s movies on Youtube.
* As a Marvel fan whose search did not get any results, I see a message and an an entertaining gif so that I am informed that my search did not get  results. 
* As a Marvel fan who has completed at least one search, I can see my previous search in the app so that I can choose to repeat my previous search if I wish.

## Features
The Marvel Superhero Genie app uses two APIs to retrieve data
1. **The Marvel API** **TODO - Jess add more info and link**
2. **The YouTube Data API** - The YouTube API [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/) is configured to use the superhero's name, returned from the Marvel API, to retrieve videos from the Marvel Entertainment YouTube channel. 

## Future Work

Requirements planned to be implemented in the future may include: 
* As a Marvel fan, I can watch the Youtube video of my superhero autoplay in the app so I don’t need to click onto the video to start playing the video.
* As a Marvel fan, I can choose to receive more information about my searched superhero such as their stories and comics, movies they star in, their weapons, trivia and habits (etc) so that I can fulfil my curiousity about Marvel superheroes.
* As a Marvel fan, I can enter one or more letters in a superhero name search to see a list of ALL superheroes starting with that letter, so that I can see which superheros start with those letters.
* As a Marvel fan whose search has received a list of superheroes, I can choose to see more about one of the superheros in the list by clicking on their search result so that I can learn more about that superhero.
* As a Marvel fan, I can search using several criteria to find a superhero so that I can see which superheroes meet that criteria (e.g. search by superpower, weapons, vehicle, etc …)
* As a Marvel fan, I want to complete a quiz so that I find out what superhero I am and find out more information about that superhero
